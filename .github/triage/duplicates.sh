# titles, the second reads those few in full and keeps only the ones it can say why about. The
# model never talks to GitHub, this script does, and it drops any number that was not on the
# shortlist, so the worst a bad answer can do is link the wrong existing issue.

This may already be reported:

If it is the same thing, close this one and follow the older issue for updates. If it is not, leave it open and say so, and a maintainer will take it from here.
