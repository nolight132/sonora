# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added an About tab in settings carrying the copyright, the warranty disclaimer and links to the
  license and the source.
- Added `THIRD-PARTY.md`, listing every bundled dependency and the full text of every license.
  Packages and release archives now ship it alongside the Inter and Lucide license files.

### Changed

- **Licensing.** Sonora is now released under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
  Earlier releases carried no license file at all, which left them undistributable; GPUI depends on
  `zlog` and `ztracing` from the Zed repository, both GPL-3.0-or-later, so every binary ever built
  from this tree was already covered by the GPL. Versions 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 are therefore to be read
  as GPL-3.0-or-later as well.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Localized the interface with Fluent, shipping English, Russian, Ukrainian and Polish.
- Added a language setting that follows the system locale by default.
- Added an application icon for macOS, Linux and the disk image.

### Changed

- Releases now ship bare executables for Linux and Windows and a universal disk image for macOS.
- Shuffle moved into the queue, so the queue panel shows the order that will actually play.

### Fixed

- Capped the volume taper at unity gain; the top of the slider no longer clips.
- Aligned the scrubber thumb with the pointer across the whole track.
