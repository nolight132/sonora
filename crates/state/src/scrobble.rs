//! Scrobbling
//!
//! One entity drives every service at once. [`Scrobbling`] holds a [`ScrobbleRow`] per service, follows
//! [`Playback`] and fans the same listen out to whichever rows are linked and turned on. The
//! provider the track came from hears about it too, so a server such as Navidrome keeps its own
//! play counts and now-playing list.
