//! The system CDM, hosted in a helper process the way a browser runs its CDM in a utility
//! process.
//!
//! The module never maps into the app. [`Cdm::open`] starts the Sonora executable again as the
//! host in [`crate::host`] and talks to it over its stdin and stdout, and every [`Cdm`] is a
//! lease on that one process. There is one host at a time, every call to it is serialized, and
//! its session accumulates content keys rather than replacing them, so more than one track can
//! be licensed at once. That is what makes preloading the next track possible.
//!
//! The host stays up while any lease is held and for a grace period after the last one goes, so
//! a track change does not restart it. Then its stdin is closed and it exits, taking the module's
//! memory with it. A host that takes too long over one call is killed, so a wedged module costs
//! one failed track rather than a hung player.
