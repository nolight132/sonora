//! The framing between Sonora and its CDM host process, over the host's stdin and stdout.
//!
//! A request is an op byte, a little-endian `u32` payload length and the payload. An answer is
//! a status byte, a length and a payload, and a failure carries its message as UTF-8. The host
//! sends one answer before any request, saying whether the module opened. Its payload is the
//! host's [`VERSION`], so an app that finds a different build on disk refuses to talk to it.
//!
//! A decrypt payload is the 16 byte IV, the key id length as a `u32` and the key id, the
//! subsample count as a `u32` and that many clear and cipher `u32` pairs, then the sample to the
//! end of the frame. Its answer is the cleartext, exactly as long as the sample.
