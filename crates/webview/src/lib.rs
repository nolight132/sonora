//! A native browser window with a throwaway session, for the two jobs that need a real engine.
//!
//! The window loads a page in a data store that lives only as long as the window. Once the proof
//! cookies appear, their header is handed back and the window closes. No browser profile ever
//! holds that session, so nothing rotates the cookies behind the app's back the way a shared
//! browser session does.
//!
//! The first job is signing in: the user works through the provider's pages and the proof cookies
//! are the session. The second is running a script on a page the app cannot reach any other way,
//! which is how YouTube's proof-of-origin token is minted; that window is hidden and its script
//! leaves the answer in a cookie the same poll reads.
//!
//! An account provider can finish the sign-in on an interstitial of its own — Google's security
//! check-up, say — that jumps straight to the return url and skips the hop that hands the account
//! to the provider's domain. The page then comes up signed out. When that happens, the sign-in url
//! is loaded once more: with the account already in, it only runs the hop that was skipped, which
//! is exactly what the page's own Sign in button would do.
//!
//! macOS, Windows and Linux have native backends. Every other platform reports
//! `supported() == false` and `Page::open` fails, so a caller falls back to pasting a header or
//! goes without a token.
