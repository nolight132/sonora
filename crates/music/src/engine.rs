//! One playback engine, for every provider whose tracks are a file to decode.
//!
//! Two threads share the work the way the Spotify path does: a tokio thread fetches, and one
//! audio thread decodes and feeds [`crate::sink::Paced`]. Neither the audio callback nor the
//! runtime ever waits on the network, so a track starts as soon as its first seconds are in.
//! The engine owns everything that is the same whoever the provider is: the queue of commands,
//! the preload, the gapless join, where a position is reported from, and what a lost output
//! device does.
//!
//! A provider supplies [`Fetch`]: how to get a track and how to open a decoder over it. Every
//! provider but Spotify does, whose decoding librespot owns. Local reads a file from disk,
//! YouTube asks for the file a range at a time, Subsonic hands over a plain response, Deezer
//! decrypts Blowfish stripes as they arrive, and Apple Music indexes CENC fragments and decrypts
//! each sample through a CDM as the decoder reaches it.
//!
//! Loudness normalisation lives here too. A provider only reports how loud a track is, and the
//! engine decides what gain that earns.
