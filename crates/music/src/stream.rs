//! A track downloaded while it plays. The decoder reads from the front of one spool while the
//! response keeps filling the back, so playback starts after a short preroll instead of after
//! the whole file.
//!
//! The spool is an unlinked file in the cache directory, so a track sits in the page cache
//! rather than on the heap, and the kernel can drop it under pressure where it could never drop
//! a buffer. Memory is the fallback for a system where no such file can be made.
//!
//! Every provider that streams a file over HTTP uses this. What differs between them is where
//! the bytes come from, which is [`Source`], and what happens to them, which is [`Body`].
//! Subsonic and YouTube Music take them as they come, Deezer decrypts each Blowfish stripe as
//! it lands, and Apple Music indexes CENC fragments and hands each sample to a CDM the moment a
//! reader asks for it. Everything else, the waiting and the seeking and what a broken
//! connection does, is the same for all of them and lives here.
