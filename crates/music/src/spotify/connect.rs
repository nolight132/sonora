//! Sonora as a Spotify Connect device. It tells Spotify what plays, so Spotify's apps and
//! Discord show it, takes the commands their controls send, and lists and drives the account's
//! other devices.
//!
//! librespot's own `Spirc` does the same but wants to own the queue, so this speaks the same
//! protocol straight through the session's dealer and spclient and leaves the queue to Sonora.
