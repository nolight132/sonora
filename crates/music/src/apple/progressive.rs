//! An Apple Music track that decrypts as it is read, over bytes that are still arriving.
//!
//! The waiting, the seeking and the splice are [`crate::stream`]'s, the same spool every other
//! provider streams through. What is Apple's own is the [`Cenc`] body: each `moof`/`mdat` pair
//! is indexed as it completes, and a sample is handed to the CDM the moment a reader asks for
//! the bytes it covers. CENC is size preserving and every sample carries its own IV, so
//! decryption happens in place and in any order, and playback starts on the first fragment
//! rather than the last.
//!
//! Decryption runs on whichever thread reads, which is the engine's audio thread and never a
//! tokio worker or the output callback. A sample costs about one and a half milliseconds, nearly
//! all of it inside the CDM rather than on the way to its host process, so one second of audio
//! costs about seventy, well inside what the output has queued.
//!
//! The track is spooled in memory rather than to a file, because samples are decrypted in place
//! and cleartext must never reach the disk.
//!
//! Once the download is complete, a background pass decrypts every sample no read has reached
//! and then gives the license back. The CDM lives in a host process that exits when no track
//! holds a license, so a track that is paused, queued or left behind by another provider does
//! not keep it running.
