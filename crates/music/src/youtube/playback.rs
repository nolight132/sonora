//! Playback for YouTube Music: what [`crate::engine`] needs that is YouTube's own.
//!
//! The track streams through [`crate::stream`] like every other provider's, fed by ytmusic's
//! ranged download, which asks again from the byte a stalled connection stopped at. The file is
//! DASH fMP4, so the decoder opens it unseekable and a seek splices the header onto the segment
//! the `sidx` names, the way Apple Music's does. The threads, the queue, the preload, the gapless
//! join and the loudness gain are the engine's.
